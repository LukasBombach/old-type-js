Developing a text editor in a browser environment differs from implementing a text editor in a desktop einvironment. Any implementation is based on the axioms of the browsers. Development is generally restricted to the components and APIs offered by the HTML5 standard and experimental features that are usually implemented in a subset of browsers\footnote{If a specific component or API can be used is determined by the intended audience and browser market share.}. However, the boundaries of these restrictions can be pushed. It is common practice to combine native elements and APIs\footnote{Native to the browser, not the operating system.} in ways they have not been designed for to enable features not natively offered. These techniques are often reffered to as ''hacks'' and, despite their terminolagy, are generally not regarded as a bad practice.

This chapter will describe the basics of text and rich-text editing in browsers as well as the APIs and techniques used. The origins and the history of rich-text editing pose the question if the paradigms rich-text editing is based on have been thoroughly reviewed and if alternative ways for an implementation, possibly using hacks, could be considered.
