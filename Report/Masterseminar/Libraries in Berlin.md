# Libraries in Berlin

I went to the Central library TU Berlin. I have been there before and was quite fond of it. To try something I did not already know, I planned on visiting the Computer Science library or main library FU Berlin, but it would have taken me 1:40 hours to get there, which seems unreasonable, if I plan on going there on a regular basis.

## Are there recent books on media and computing available? On general computing? What signature systematic is used for computing literature?

A little less on "media and computing", but a few books on computer science. To be honest, the collection is quite small and disappointing. They can be found on the first floor and are grouped by topics of computer science. They also have an archive of old literature predating the year 2000.

## Are there recent periodicals on media and computing available? On general computing?

Yes. There are two rows of periodicals on media and computing including journals on various topics as well as a collection of computer science magazines like "Chip" or "C't"

## Does the library have a scanner? How does it work?

They have a copy room (I'm guessing multiple rooms, acutally) where you can just use one of their scanners.
A registration or "log in" at the scanners is not required. You can copy your scan on a USB stick, send it
via e-mail or even save it to your dropbox.

## Obtain a library card for the library (except for StaBi, there you only need to get a day card)

Check.

## Are there places to work in the library? How crowded is it?

I went there on a Friday morning. The library was well frequented, but not crowded. As libraries are, and from what I have experienced here before, the place was appropriately silent. I could find a place to sit easily.

## What is the URL of the OPAC for this library?

 * [http://opac.ub.tu-berlin.de/](http://opac.ub.tu-berlin.de/) (Old and will no longer be maintained)
 * [http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=TUB](http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=TUB) (New catalog)

## Are there online databases that can only be used at the library that are relevant for your work?

Yes, most of them. They can be found using the [Datenbankenangebot on the TU's library's Website](http://rzblx10.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/fachliste.php?bib_id=tubb&colors=255&ocolors=40&lett=l). They have a section for computer science which will be what I am looking for.

## How do you obtain an electronic publication at this library?

Using the ["new catalog" I  mentioned earlier](http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/), you need to click "Online-Publikationen" and search the database. Online publications can only be accessed via the TU network.

## How do interlibrary loans work?

If a book or paper is not available at the TU's library, I can request a interlibrary loan, which will cost 1,50â‚¬ per item and can by used for 4 weeks with no option to extend that period.

## Do they have a cafeteria?

Yes, ground floor to the left.

## Find and document 10 items that are relevant to your thesis.

 1. A Survey on Tree Edit Distance and Related Problems

 Facebook calls this the state of the art on generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. May be useful to me when I alter the representation of my document data or the output as DOM / HTML.

 2. THE TECHNOLOGY OF WORD PROCESSING

 A paper from 1981, which seems to be exactly the time and age I will have to look into. It should cover some basics on implementing a word processor.

 3. Operational Transformation for Collaborative Word Processing

 A paper on collaborative text editing.

 4. RUMU Editor: A Non-WYSIWYG Web Editor for Non-Technical Users

 This paper describes the concept of a non-WYSIWYG editor for the web, that still will produce markup. They have reasons for doing this. I want to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it.

 5. Optimization of HTML Automatically Generated by WYSIWYG Programs

 This paper describes algorithms for optimizing the mess (e.g. the code) that current web-based WYSIWYG editors produce. This may help me acquiring a better understanding of the problems with current WYSIWYG editors and might reveal some techniques that could come in handy for me.

 6. The Web Page as a WYSIWYG End-User Customizable Database-Backed Information Management Application

 This is a paper that incorporates the implementation of a WYSIWYG editor. I want to find out how they did it.

 7. Design Case Study: The Bravo Text Editor

 I hope this will give some insights on particular components of writing a text editor.

 8. A Programmable Editor for Developing Structured Documents based on Bidirectional Transformations

 Describes the implementation of a novel editor which I hope I can learn from.

 9. What has WYSIWYG done to us?

 A paper criticizing WYSIWYG editing.

 10. Virtual DOM: An Efficient Virtual Memory Representation for Large XML Documents

 Explains a technique to store XML in an efficient data structure using Java. I want to learn from this for my representation of the text in the editor.

## Find a paper (max 10 pages) in a journal that is relevant to your thesis topic for the Journal club.

I chose *A Survey on Tree Edit Distance and Related Problems*. It has more than 10 pages, but it is really essential for me to understand and I really want to work on it.
