# Libraries in Berlin

I went to the Central library TU Berlin. I have been there before and was quite fond of it. To try something I did not already know, I planned to visit the Computer Science library or main library, FU Berlin, but it would have taken me 1:40 hours to get there, which seems unreasonable, if I plan on going there on a regular basis.

## Are there recent books on media and computing available? On general computing? What signature systematic is used for computing literature?

A little less on "media and computing", but a few books on computer science. To be honest, the collection is quite small and disappointing. They can be found on the first floor and are grouped by computer-scientific topics. They also have an archive of old literature from books predating the year 2000.

## Are there recent periodicals on media and computing available? On general computing?

Yes. There are two rows of periodicals on media and computing including journals on various topics as well as a collection of computer science magazines like "Chip" or "C't"

## Does the library have a scanner? How does it work?

They have a copy room (I'm guessing multiple rooms, acutally) where you can just use one of their scanners.
A registration or "log in" at the scanners is not required. You can copy your scan on a USB stick, sent it
via e-mail or even save it to your dropbox.

## Obtain a library card for the library (except for StaBi, there you only need to get a day card)

Check.

## Are there places to work in the library? How crowded is it?

I went there on a Friday morning. The library was well frequented, but not crowded. As libraries are, and from what I have experienced here before, the place was appropriately silent. I could find a place to sit easily.

## What is the URL of the OPAC for this library?

 * [http://opac.ub.tu-berlin.de/](http://opac.ub.tu-berlin.de/) (Old and will no longer be maintained)
 * [http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=TUB](http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=TUB) (New catalog)

## Are there online databases that can only be used at the library that are relevant for your work?

Yes, most of them. They can be found using the [Datenbankenangebot on the TU's library's Website](http://rzblx10.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/fachliste.php?bib_id=tubb&colors=255&ocolors=40&lett=l). They have a section for computer science which will be what I am looking for.

## How do you obtain an electronic publication at this library?

Using the ["new catalog" I  mentioned earlier](http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/), you need to click "Online-Publikationen" and search the database. Online publications can only be accessed via the TU network

## How do interlibrary loans work?

If a book or paper is not available at the TU's library, I can request a interlibrary loan, which will cost 1,50â‚¬ per item and can by used for 4 weeks with no option to extend the period.

## Do they have a cafeteria?

Yes, ground floor to the left.

## Find and document 10 items that are relevant to your thesis.


## Find a paper (max 10 pages) in a journal that is relevant to your thesis topic for the Journal club. Either scan it from a printed version or download it from a database. Upload the paper to the Journal Club forum (in the next block) by 22:00 on Sunday, April 26, 2015.
