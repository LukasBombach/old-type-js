%% The text of your abstract and nothing else (other than comments) goes here.
%% It will be single-spaced and the rest of the text that is supposed to go on
%% the abstract page will be generated by the abstractpage environment.  This

Browsers do not offer native elements that allow for WYSIWYG text editing. There are third-party libraries that emulate these elements by utilizing the \texttt{contenteditable}-attribute. However, the API enabled by \texttt{contenteditable} is limited and unstable. Bugs and unwanted behavior can only be worked around and not fixed. The library ''Type'' demonstrates that WYSIWYG editing can be achieved without requiring the \texttt{contenteditable} attribute, thus solving many problems contemporary WYSIWYG editor libraries have.
