Over time, the bugs of HTML editing APIs will decrease. Its clipboard capabilites are on the way to be expanded. The API still is still limited and needs a revision. It is even imaginable to rethink the way \code{contenteditable} works. Editors that, for instance, implement layouting, like Google's document editor, still cannot be implemented with the way HTML Editing APIs are designed.

To allow a transition from current HTML editing APIs and an interface with a cleaner and richer functionality, it is thinkable to introduce a new ''class'' alongside the old API. This has been done with other functionality, for examle mal aus MDN raussuchen. This way the old API can die gracefully while webdevelopers slowly adopt. It can be hoped that if the API is much better, the adoption will happen quickly.


As discussed in \refsubsec{subsec:edit_api_adv_thir_party_lang} my design as a library with a super duper api allows implementing highlighting for other languages like bb code or markdown. \textit{There should be a part in CONCEPT that explains this idea, either explaining its made for extensibility or in how cool my api is i mean the design as a lib and not as an editor is}
