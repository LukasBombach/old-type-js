\section{Motivation}

Written texts are the most important cultural tool to pass on knowledge from one generation to another. Designing texts, layouting, adding images and choosing text formattings is an important means to convey a message and to clarify ideas. A newspaper written as a single stream of words would not have served the purpose, that it has for hundreds of years.
With the computerization of printing, PCs have been the tool to generate and design texts for decades. There are software solutions for professional and personal use on Desktop PCs.
In recent years, many desktop applications have been migrated to browser-based solutions. This has many advantages. Applications can be maintained in a centralized manner and any computer using the software will be updated automatically. Browser-based applications can be accessed from anywhere in the world, without requiring to install further applications. Contents can be shared and edited collaboratively with others.

Still, editing rich-text in a browser, i.e. text that uses formattings and layouting, is not easily implementable for web developer.
