\section{Plain-text editing}

Text input components for browsers have been introduced with the specification of HTML 2.0\footnote{\url{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866}, last checked on 07/15/2015}. The components proposed include inputs for single line (written as \code{<input type="text" />}) and multiline texts (written as \code{<textarea></textarea>}). These inputs allow writing plain-text only.
