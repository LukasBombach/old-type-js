\section{Rich-text editing}

Major browsers, i.e. any browser with a market share above 0.5\%\footnote{\url{http://gs.statcounter.com/\#all-browser-ww-monthly-201406-201506-bar}, last checked on 07/25/2015}, do not offer native input fields that allow rich-text editing. Neither the W3C's HTML5 and HTML5.1 specifications nor the WHATWG's ''HTML Living Standard''\footnote{The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) is a working group that mainly developed the HTML5 standard, which later resulted in the widely acknowledged ''HTML Living Standard'' see \refsection{sec:standardization-of-html-editing-apis}} recommend such elements. As discussed in \refsection{sec:html_sgml_def}, by being able to display HTML, browsers are rich-text viewers. By the early 2000s, the first JavaScript libraries emerged, that allowed users to interactively change (parts of) a website to enable rich-text editing in the browser. The techniques used will be discussed in section~\ref{sec:html-editing-apis} through section~\ref{sec:useage-of-html-editing-apis}.
