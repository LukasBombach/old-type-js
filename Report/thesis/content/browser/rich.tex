\section{Rich-text editing}

Major browsers, i.e. any browser with a market share above 0.5\%\cite{ag}, do not offer native input fields that allow rich-text editing. Neither the W3C's HTML5 and HTML5.1 specifications nor the WHATWG HTML specification recommend such elements. However, by being able to display HTML, browsers effectively are rich-text viewers. By the early 2000s, the first JavaScript libraries emerged, that allowed users to interactively change (parts of) a website to enable rich-text editing in the browser. The techniques used will be discussed in section~\ref{sec:html-editing-apis} through section~\ref{sec:useage-of-html-editing-apis}.
