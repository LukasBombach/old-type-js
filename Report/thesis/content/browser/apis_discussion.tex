\refchapter{ch:editing_apis_history} will discuss the history and origins of HTML editing APIs. \refchapter{ch:editing_apis_adv_disadv} will discuss its advantages and disadvantages and
\refchapter{ch:editing_apis_alt} will discuss possible alternatives.

%This section will discuss the origins and adaption of HTML editing APIs as well as its advantages, disadvantages and alternatives.
