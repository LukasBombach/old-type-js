This section will discuss the options to implement rich-text editing without relying (entirely) on HTML editing APIs and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. % Diese Art zu schreiben sollte der Style der Arbeit sein.

\paragraph{Native input elements} Native text inputs are hard-wired to plain-text editing. No major browser offers an API for formatting. There is also no option to write HTML to an input and have it display it as rich-text. \texttt{input} fields and \texttt{textarea} elements will simply display the HTML as source code. Rich-text can only be implemented as an editable part of the website.

\paragraph{Enabling editing mode without using its API} One way to enable editing but avoiding many bugs and browser inonstistencies, is to enable the editing mode on an element, but avoid using \texttt{execCommand} to format the text. The latter could be implemented using the DOM core APIs. This would provide the user with all basic editing functions, i.e. a caret, text input, mouse interaction and clipboard capabilites. All of this would be taken care of by the browser.

This sem-radical approach would solve the problem of buggy and inconsistent \texttt{execCommand} implementations but not the problems that arise with different browser behavior on the user's text input---for instance when entering a line break. If the markup is customly generated with JavaScript, the input may break elements or simply get stuck. This was one of the reasons why Google decided to abandon editing APIs entirely\footnote{\url{http://googledrive.blogspot.fr/2010/05/whats-different-about-new-google-docs.html}, last checked on 07/21/2015}. It could be the source to many bugs, have the development of the library be dependent on browser development and ultimatively restrict the editors capabilites.

\paragraph{Native text input imitation} The only other option to allow the user to change the text on a website is by manually fetching the user's input and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript. However, this does not suffice to provide the experience of a text input. The following components, common to text editing, must also be accounted for:
% These components will be discussed hereinafter.

%, major browsers offer no way to place a caret

% Only native text input components and elements in editing mode
% ''ACE'' and ''CodeMirror'' demonstrate an effective way to imitate a text input. 

 %''ACE'' and ''CodeMirror'' demonstrate it is possible to imitate a text input by composing various DOM ele
\paragraph{Caret} The most obvious part is probably the text caret. Even if a user types on his or her keyboard, a caret must be seen on the screen to know where the input will be inserted. The caret also needs to be responsive to the user's interaction. In particular, the user must be able to click anywhere in the editable text and use the arrow keys to move it (possibly using modifier keys, which's behaviour even depends on the operating system used).

\paragraph{Selection} Just like the caret, the user must be able to draw a text selection using his or her mouse and change the selection using shift and the arrow keys. Most systems allow double clicks to select words and sometimes tripple clicks to select entire paragraphs. Other systems, for example OS X, allow holding the option key to draw are rectengular text selection, independent of line breaks.

\paragraph{Context menu} The context menu is different in text inputs from other elements on a website. Most importantly, it offers an option to paste text, that is only available in native text inputs or elements in editing mode.

\paragraph{Keyboard shortcuts} Text inputs usually allow keyboard shortcuts to format the text and to perform clipboard operations. Formatting the text is possible through DOM manipulation, pasting text however natively only works on text inputs or elements in editing mode. % is a challenge, since browsers do not offer arbitrary access to the clipboard for security reasons.

\paragraph{Undo / Redo} Undo and redo are common functions of text processing and it may be frustrating to users if they were missing.

\paragraph{Behaviour} Rich-text editors (usually) share a certain behaviour on user input. When writing a bulleted list, pressing the enter key usually creates another bulleting point instead of inserting a new line. Pressing enter inside a heading will insert a new line. However pressing enter when the caret is located at the end of a heading commonly creates a new text paragraph just after that heading. Other rules that need to be considered will be discussed in section [implementation].

\paragraph{Imitating native components} These components are natively available for text inputs across all browsers. Switching an element to editing mode enables these components too. That means a user can click in a text to place a caret and move it with the keyboard's arrow keys. He or she can copy and paste text. The browser offers a native context menu that allows pasting on input elements as well as on element in editing mode. All major browsers implement a behaviour for the user' input that is common for rich-text editing (as described above).

When not using editing APIs, all of this must be implemented with JavaScript. This requires a lot of trickery and many components must be imitated to make it \textit{seem} there is an input field, where there is none. The user must be convinced he or she is using a native input and must not notice he or she is not.

\caption{Rendering of highlighted source code in Ace and CodeMirror}
\label{fig:ace_rendering_uml}
\end{figure}


Web-based code editors like ''Ace'' and ''CodeMirror'' demonstrate that this is possible. They display syntax-highlighted source code editable by the user. The user seemingly writes inside the highlighted text and is also presented with a caret as well as the above mentioned components. In reality, the content inside the editor that a user sees is a regular part of the DOM---non-editable text, colored and formatted using HTML and CSS. When the user enters text, the input will be read with JavaScript. Based on the input Ace and CodeMirror generate HTML and add it to the editors contents, to show a properly syntax-highlighted representation (see figure~\ref{fig:ace_rendering_uml}). A \texttt{div} element that is styled to look like a caret is shown and moved with the user's keyboard and mouse input. The user's text input will be inserted at the according text offset. Amongst others, Ace and CodeMirror use other elements like \texttt{div}s to display a text selection and a \texttt{textarea} to fetch keyboard inputs, to recreate the behavior and capabilites of a native text input. Google's document editor uses similar techniques too.

%In reality, the user's input will be read with JavaScript and the code he or she sees is HTML generated based on this input to display syntax-highlighted text. Other components, like the caret and even the selection \texttt{div} elements, styled and positioned to mimick their native counterparts. 

%All this creates the illusion of a native text input.

%Many of the techniques to mimick a native text input like this can be found in web-based code editors like ''ACE'' or ''CodeMirror''.

Using tricks and \textit{faking} elements or behavior is common in web front end development. This applies to JavaScript as well as to CSS. For instance, long before CSS3 has been developed, techniques (often called ''hacks'') have been discussed on how to implement rounded corners without actual browser support. Only years later, this has become a standard. This not only enables features long before the creators of browsers implement them, this \textit{feedback} by the community of web developers also influences future standards. Encorporating feedback is a core philisophy of the WHATWG, the creators of HTML5.

\section{Mimicking native components for rich-text editing}

The techniques used in Ace, CodeMirror and Google's document editor for imitating a native text input are similar. For the caret, each of the editors create a \texttt{div}, style it to make it look like a caret\footnote{inlcuding a blinking animation} and move it when the user clicks in the text or uses his or her arrow keys. Each editor uses \texttt{div} elements to display a text selection, styled to imitate the user's operating system's native selections.

Components like the caret must be displayed in any

\section{Leave as much implementation to the browser as possible} 

"Easy to make it fast -- The browser (not the app) handles the most computationally intensive task: text layout. Since layout is a core component of browser functionality, you can trust that layout performance has already been heavily optimized." http://googledrive.blogspot.fr/2010/05/whats-different-about-new-google-docs.html

\section{Markup} 

Our editor should be a good citizen in this ecosystem. That means we ought to produce HTML that’s easy to read and understand. And on the flip side, we need to be aware that our editor has to deal with pasted content that can’t possibly be created in our editor. https://medium.com/medium-eng/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480

Also FirePad and Google generate unusable markup. we're gonna generate semantic markup, simple and clean.

%\section{Partially using HTML editing APIs}

\section{MVC}

Document model -> no
Ursprünglich MVC mäßig mit document im kern geplant 

\section{Events}

Dazu entscheiden dass es ein Type-Internes Eventsystem gibt, dessen Events nur in Type existieren. Damit polluten die nicht den globalen (name)space mit events. Nur bestimmte events werden global (nativ) getriggert, und das sind genau die events, die nach aussenhin von Belang sind und abgegriffen werden koennen sollen (=API design)

\section{Stability and performance}

\paragraph{Cache} For traversing the text, for example when the caret moves, the text will need to be measured. All measurements can be stored to a cache to only perform the same measurement operations once. On the other hand, the library should be a ''good citizen'' on a website, which means it should be as unobtrusive and leave the developers as much freedom as possible. The library will essentially modify parts of the DOM that act as the editor's contents. It should be agnostic to the editor's contents at all times to give other developers the freedom to change the contents in any way needed without breaking the editor. A cache must account for external changes. The DOM3 Events specification\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/}, last checked on 07/21/2015} offers \texttt{MutationObserver}s to check for DOM changes. This feature is not supported by Internet Explorer version 10 or less\footnote{\url{http://caniuse.com/\#search=mutation}, last checked on 07/21/2015}. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 offer an implementation for \texttt{MutationEvent}s\footnote{\url{http://help.dottoro.com/ljfvvdnm.php\#additionalEvents }, last checked on 07/21/2015}. The W3C states that ''The MutationEvent interface [...] has not yet been completely and interoperably implemented across user agents. In addition, there have been critiques that the interface, as designed, introduces a performance and implementation challenge.''\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/\#legacy-mutationevent-events}, last checked on 07/21/2015}. Apart from that, the benefits of a cache may not signifcantly increase the library's performance. The actions that can be supported by a cache, most importantly moving the caret in the text, are not very complex and do not noticably afflict the CPU. Implementing an editor that is stateless in regards of its contents can also improve stability.

% dom operations could also be cached

\paragraph{Minimze interaction with the DOM} DOM operations are slow and should be avoided. DOM operations can be ''collected'' and only executed when necessary etc pp like React.

\paragraph{Minimze interaction with unstable APIs} Some APIs like the \texttt{Range} or \texttt{Selection} are prone to numerous bugs. To maximize stability, these APIs should be avoided when possible unless doing so has any downsides (like lower performance).


\section{API Design}

Allgemeine Überlegungen wie man ein Framework gestaltet (siehe ''Freiheit für Programmierer'', gute Arbeitsweise)
Ursprünglich API und Codestruktur an window.execCommand orientiert, das ist aber doof.
Bessere (weil präzisere) API mit mehr Möglichkeiten als der contentEditable scheiss
für Programmierer und für 2 anwendungsfälle:
einen editor bauen
type mit plugins erweitern
für beides gibt es die passenden Funktionen, das eine einfach und schlau, das andere präzise
Deswegen werden auch alle Module, alle Klassen exponiert aber es gibt eine eigene API nach jQuery konzept
Type kommt mit bestimmten Kernmodulen die fuer Textbearbeitung essenziell sind. Aber an dieser Stelle laesst sich Type um weitere Module anhand einer KOnvention (erweitern des Type Objekts) erweitern.
